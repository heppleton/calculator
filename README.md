# calculator
A retro-styled calculator broadly styled after the Texas Instruments TI-150.

This project was undertaken in the early stages of learning JS, HTML, and CSS. The code is therefore very basic and should not be taken as representative of current abilities.

However, the behaviour and style of the calculator are excellent. I'm happy with what I could create with limited tools.
